# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction
Customer Lifetime Value represents a customer’s value to a company over a period of time. It’s a competitive market for insurance companies in 2019, and insurance premium isn’t the only determining factor in a customer’s decisions. CLV is a customer-centric metric, and a powerful base to build upon to retain valuable customers, increase revenue from less valuable customers, and improve the customer experience overall.
The goal of this project is to predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using machine learning techniques. CLV is a critical metric for businesses to understand the total value a customer brings over their lifetime. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Project Thoughts:
During the creation of this project, I considered several factors:
Data Quality: Ensuring the dataset is clean and relevant.
Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features that help in predicting CLV accurately.
Model Selection: Experimenting with various models to find the best-performing one.
Evaluation Metrics: Using appropriate metrics to evaluate model performance.
